                Our specialized sewer pipe lining method allows us to fix pipe lines so they will work for years without the need of destroying any road or yard. 
                Instead of removing your old pipes this method uses Cured-in-Place-Piplining otherwise known as CIPP to restore the inner walls of your pips. 
                This will allow your pipes to work without fail for a long time and with minimal damage to the surrounding.

                <b>Sewer Lateral Pipe Lining</b>
                <p>If you are ever having issues with pooling water or drainage that is probably due to your lateral pipe needing to be fixed. 
                   If you do not know what lateral pipes are they are the pipes that go to your property from your city's main sewer line. 
                   M&B services are able to imporve your pipes without the hassle of removing them and ruining your yard.
